The data used in this analyis are not publically available. Please contact the corresponding author of the paper for access.

The five R scripts beginning with "PELT" are associated with paper "A changepoint approach to automated estimation of soil moisture drydown parameters from time series data" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-27067-w). The data used in this analysis are available in the folder "Application_data".
