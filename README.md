# SitS-Analysis
R code for analysing soil sensor data and field sampling data for the Signals in the Soils (SitS) project.

This repository contains R scripts for analysing the sensor and field data, and the output generated from the models. The analyses are associated with two publications, "Multiple targeted grassland restoration interventions enhance ecosystem service multifunctionality" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59157-8) and "A changepoint approach to automated estimation of soil moisture drydown parameters from time series data" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-27067-w).
