# SitS-Analysis

This repository contains R scripts for analysing soil sensor data and field sampling data from the Signals in the Soils (SitS) project.

The three R scripts beginning with "ColtPark" are associated with the analyses in paper "Multiple targeted grassland restoration interventions enhance ecosystem service multifunctionality" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59157-8), which investigated the effect of different treatment combinations on ecosystem multifunctionality. The data used in this analyis are not publically available. Please contact the corresponding author of the paper for access.

The five R scripts beginning with "PELT" are associated with the analyses in paper "A changepoint approach to automated estimation of soil moisture drydown parameters from time series data" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-27067-w), which investigated the distributions of soil moisture drydown parameters and the delays in peaks of soil moisture across the soil profile. The data used in this analysis are available in the folder "Application_data".
